## ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION: Use a Different Approach

If you want to avoid Google's restrictions entirely, you could:
1. Use a simpler email/password system only
2. Use a different OAuth provider (Facebook, GitHub, etc.)
3. Use Google Sign-In for development only

## RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

**For immediate use (today):**
- Use Solution 1: Add test users

**For public launch:**
- Use Solution 2: Make app public

**For scale (100+ users):**
- Use Solution 3: Get app verified
