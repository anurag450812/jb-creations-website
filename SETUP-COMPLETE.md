# ✅ Setup Complete! - JB Creations OTP System

## 🎉 What's Been Done

### ✅ 1. Dependencies Installed
- Installed `axios`, `jsonwebtoken`, `firebase-admin` in `netlify/functions/`
- Installed Netlify CLI globally for local testing and deployment
- All dependencies successfully installed with no errors

### ✅ 2. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env` file in project root with:
  - Fast2SMS API Key
  - Fast2SMS Template ID
  - Fast2SMS Sender ID
  - JWT Secret
- Environment variables are being loaded by Netlify Dev ✅

### ✅ 3. Frontend Updated
- Updated `otp-login.html` to use `fast2sms-client-production.js`
- Changed initialization to auto-detect local vs production environment
- No more hardcoded `localhost:3001` - uses Netlify Functions automatically

### ✅ 4. Local Development Server Running
- **Netlify Dev is running at: http://localhost:8888** 🚀
- OTP login page opened in browser
- Functions are available at: `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/`

2. Check Netlify Dev terminal for function logs
3. Verify Fast2SMS API key is correct

### If "Function not found" error:
1. Make sure Netlify Dev is running
2. Refresh the page
3. Check console for correct endpoint URL

### If in demo mode:
- Fast2SMS is configured, so you should get real SMS
- If you see "demo mode", check environment variables
