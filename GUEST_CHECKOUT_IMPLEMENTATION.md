### Data Structure Enhancements

#### Order Data Structure
```javascript
{
    customer: {
        userId: null,           // null for guests
        isGuest: true,          // guest indicator
        name: "Customer Name",
        email: "email@example.com",
        phone: "phone",
        address: "address",
        specialInstructions: "notes"
    },
    customerType: "guest",      // "guest" or "registered"
    orderNumber: "JB123456789",
    orderDate: "2025-08-27T...",
    status: "pending",
    // ... rest of order data
}
```

#### Guest Order History Structure
```javascript
// Stored in localStorage as 'jb_guest_orders'
[
    {
        orderNumber: "JB123456789",
        orderDate: "2025-08-27T...",
        status: "pending",
        total: 399,
        itemCount: 1,
        deliveryMethod: "standard",
        customerEmail: "email@example.com",
        customerName: "Customer Name"
    }
]
```

### Security & Privacy Considerations

#### Local Storage Management
- **Guest orders limited to 10** - Prevents storage bloat
- **No sensitive data stored** - Only order summary information
- **Email-based tracking** - Requires email verification for order lookup
- **Device-specific storage** - Orders only visible on the device used for purchase

#### Data Protection
- **No account creation required** - Reduces data collection
- **Email confirmation only** - Order details sent via email
- **Order number security** - Unique JB prefix + timestamp + random digits
- **Email verification required** - For order tracking access
